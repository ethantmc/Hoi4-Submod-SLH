  bos_nf_engineers_of_war: "Engineers of War"
  bos_nf_engineers_of_war_desc: "Until such a time that the Brotherhood can lay down their arms, the soldiers of Lost Hills will have to be prepared for anything. Many foes lurk out there in the wasteland, hungry for our knowledge with eyes of greed."
  bos_nf_room_to_grow: "Room to Grow"
  bos_nf_room_to_grow_desc: "Without our neighbouring bunkers it's going to be tough for Lost Hills to sustain itself on this site alone. We are going to need room to grow if we hope to do what the Codex proclaims."
  bos_nf_the_paladins: "The Paladins"
  bos_nf_the_paladins_desc: "It is thanks to the work of the brave Paladins that we are here today! The mightiest and most faithful of our soldiers. Men of steel charged with the fulfilment of Maxson's great vision and the protection of the future against those who would oppose her. Paladins on the battlefield are the walking tanks that nearly won the Yangtze, an unstoppable force that can oppose any obstacle."
  bos_nf_forge_new_paladins: "Forge New Paladins"
  bos_nf_forge_new_paladins_desc: "Some rather exemplary knights made their sense of honour and duty known in our conflicts with the NCR. Let us respect the sacrifices they have made to our cause by granting them the privilege, and training, required to be a full paladin of the Brotherhood."
  bos_nf_lifting_the_expeditionary_ban: "The Expeditionary Ban"
  bos_nf_lifting_the_expeditionary_ban_desc: "During the peak of the NCR-Brotherhood war, a temporary ban was placed on paladins wishing to assist distant chapters of the Brotherhood. Now that we have a cease-fire with the NCR most of the Elders agree that this ban should be revoked."
  bos_nf_the_scribes: "The Scribes"
  bos_nf_the_scribes_desc: "Scribes are a unique support that fight alongside our Paladin Divisions. They help give our Paladins the supply they need to excel in the battlefield."
  bos_nf_bringers_of_progress: "Bringers of Progress"
  bos_nf_bringers_of_progress_desc: "It is Maxson's vision that says that we, when the day has come, will be the group ordained to grant the noblest of humans our technology and splendour we have fought for all of these years. It is why we hold technology — so that, when America is ready, we can offer her the keys to civilization."
  bos_nf_keepers_of_knowledge: "Keepers of Knowledge"
  bos_nf_keepers_of_knowledge_desc: "Lost Hills has, over the last two hundred years, become one of the largest institutional centers of knowledge in the world. Holding vast swathes of information on pre-war sciences as well as an unprecedented understanding of the outside world that would be the envy of the NCR."
  bos_nf_new_developments: "New Developments"
  bos_nf_new_developments_desc: "While some see the development of new technologies on top of the old as something that could put us on the same track as the old government in ages past there is still some merit to the idea of refining the techniques we use to house and recalibrate our tech. It is important that it doesn't break down, after all."
  bos_nf_memories_of_the_fallen: "Memories of the Fallen"
  bos_nf_memories_of_the_fallen_desc: "If we don't prepare to fight, other groups — those unready for the splendour of our technology, will seek to steal from us that which we have earned ourselves. We must always be ready to fight, and always be ready to pay respects to those who made the sacrifices needed for Maxson's ideals."
  bos_nf_memories_of_heroes: "Memories of Heroes"
  bos_nf_memories_of_heroes_desc: "As the Brotherhood grows into an established and important part of this wasteland, the amount of people willing to live and die for Maxson's cause grows. Let us honour those willing to do whatever it takes to uphold the codex, Maxson's memory, and the protection of our infallible heritage."
  bos_nf_empty_suits: "Empty Suits"
  bos_nf_empty_suits_desc: "Following this intermission in the NCR-Brotherhood war plenty of suits of power armour were left abandoned due to soldiers dying in the field of battle. Let us re-appropriate these fallen soldiers' equipment and give it out so that new heroes can one day live up to their legacy."
  bos_nf_filled_with_purpose: "Filled With Purpose"
  bos_nf_filled_with_purpose_desc: "The blessed Codex gives our soldiers the strength and will needed to do what must be done for the sake of the Brotherhood."
  bos_nf_back_to_business: "Back to Business"
  bos_nf_back_to_business_desc: "Slowly, Lost Hills is returning back to its usual operations. We may have lost a few bunkers in our fight with the NCR... But as long as we hold Lost Hills we will never die. Maxson's will endures."
  bos_nf_blueprints: "Gunrunner Blueprints"
  bos_nf_blueprints_desc: "In our battles with the NCR, we acquired a few blueprints belonging formally to the NCR. We can improve on their lacklustre designs to make even better equipment!"
  bos_nf_reactionchambers:0 "Focusing Crystals"
  bos_nf_reactionchambers_desc:0 "The focusing crystals in a given laser rifle are incredibly hard to recreate, and up until this point in time, impossible to mass produce. Thankfully, that has changed, following the recovery in essential blueprints."
  bos_nf_simplified:0 "Simplified Designs"
  bos_nf_simplified_desc:0 "The Common Laser Rifle has been the reliable companion to the Brotherhood of Steel for many generations. While many within the organization are pushing towards newer weapons, the older weapons are more than sufficient when it comes to dealing with any foe."
  bos_nf_oldworld:0 "Old World Designs"
  bos_nf_oldworld_desc:0 "The Advanced Energy Weapons that we are currently prototyping are both incredibly effective and incredibly hard to make. Looking towards the future will be essential if we ever want to make use of them, which means gearing our equipment towards their production now."
  bos_nf_techreallocation:0 "Tech Reallocation"
  bos_nf_techreallocation_desc:0 "Even the Brotherhood lacks perfect logistics, and vast quantities of technology are left to waste away in storehouses and bunkers. Rechecking the books and making sure that little is wasted will carry us far."
  bos_nf_scribemaintenance:0 "Scribe Maintenance Routines"
  bos_nf_scribemaintenance_desc:0 "The Duty of a scribe is a sacred thing, for a scribe must constantly work to improve their knowledge of machines and technology, all the while striving to improve upon and master their construction and maintenance. "
  bos_nf_superioralloys:0 "Superior Alloys"
  bos_nf_superioralloys_desc:0 "The Metallic Alloys used in the creation of power armour are hard to come by, and harder still to recreate. While we have managed to perfect this art to a degree, it remains limited to older, somewhat inferior suits of armour."
  bos_nf_scraprefinement:0 "Scrap Refinement"
  bos_nf_scraprefinement_desc:0 "Our ability to find and repair more advanced pieces of power armour is becoming more important with each passing day. Gearing and training more of our scribes to work on these projects will vastly increase our ability to later sustain their production."

  bos_nf_brotherhood_r_n_d: "Brotherhood R&D"
  bos_nf_brotherhood_r_n_d_desc: "The old R&D departments of Lost Hills used to be housed in off-site bunkers, but following the NCR-Brotherhood war's destruction of several bunkers we will need to create a new department right here at Lost Hills!"
  bos_nf_weaponry_research: "Weaponry Research"

  bos_nf_SIG_sauer_weaponry: "SIG-Sauer"
  bos_nf_SIG_sauer_weaponry_desc: "For some reason, the Midwestern Brotherhood has found guns that we never saw anywhere else in the rest of the Wasteland. What is a P220, exactly?"
  bos_nf_heckler_and_koch_weaponry: "Heckler & Koch"
  bos_nf_heckler_and_koch_weaponry_desc: "Heckler was a pre-war company that manufactured firearms in Germany, including Gatling lasers. Although we unfortunately cannot reach their labs, some of their old stores have much of value"
  bos_nf_wattz_weaponry: "Wattz"
  bos_nf_wattz_weaponry_desc: "Before the war, Wattz made batteries, tape records, and laser rifles. Think of the wonders the Brotherhood could gain, if we could harness that power! Think of all the danger to the Wasteland if we didn't!"
  bos_nf_vehicle_research: "Vehicle Research"
  bos_nf_vehicle_research_desc: "Pre-war America's lust for oil was driven by its armadas of vehicles. Its cities once swarmed with cars like brahmin herds in Shady Sands. How far we've fallen! \n\nHow far we will climb back."
  bos_nf_takoma_motors: "Takoma Motors"
  bos_nf_takoma_motors_desc: "Our scribes are still not sure whether Takoma was a company before the war, or simply a place that sold cars. Some of the scribes assume the shop had great psychosexual significance, but, then, they say that about everything they don't understand. Either way, we should study what we can about this 'Takoma'."
  bos_nf_n_h_and_m_vehicles: "NH&M"
  bos_nf_n_h_and_m_vehicles_desc: "NH&M was a mighty railroad company in the East before the Great War. Perhaps we can learn how to maintain sustained long distance contact by studying their ways. Anything's better than losing more blimps."
  bos_nf_chryslus_vehicles: "Chryslus"
  bos_nf_chryslus_vehicles_desc: "The Chryslus automobiles were the peak of pre-war technology, with cars powered by the atoms themselves. If we ever want to secure the Wasteland's technology, we must know how to make a Chryslus Cherry Bomb!"
  bos_nf_industry_research: "Industry Research"
  bos_nf_industry_research_desc: "A pre-war priest wrote that 'Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufacturers flourish: and herein consists the true wealth and prosperity of a state.' If we wish to maintain our control over the Wasteland's technology, we need to make sure we understand industry."
  bos_nf_dunwich_borers: "Dunwich Borers"
  bos_nf_dunwich_borers_desc: "There are few places in the Wasteland which are truly mining, instead of salvaging the ruins of the pre-war world. We must study how the Dunwich quarry mine worked, so we can work the old ores."
  bos_nf_hornwright_industrial_mining_company: "Hornwright Industrial Company"
  bos_nf_hornwright_industrial_mining_company_desc: "Appalachia's mines were once famous the world over, and even today Appalachia is one of the richest parts of the Wasteland. We must know how the ancestors did it!"

  bos_nf_air_research: "Air Research"
  bos_nf_air_research_desc: "In ancient times, the Paladins that would form the Midwest Expedition headed out east within mighty airship vessels. While many of these relics are far and few in the wasteland there is still plenty to be learned in aeronautics."
  bos_nf_lockreed: "Lockreed"
  bos_nf_lockreed_desc: "One of our scribes is convinced this is a typo, but Lockreed built numerous passenger craft before the Great War. And aren't paladins a type of passenger?"
  bos_nf_ball_aerospace: "Ball Aerospace"
  bos_nf_ball_aerospace_desc: "Boulder's home to many wonders, and Ball was among them. One day the Brotherhood will take to the heavens, and it will be built on the work of Ball and others."
  bos_nf_repconn: "REPCONN"
  bos_nf_repconn_desc: "Rocket Engineering and Production Company of Nevada was, we are convinced, less of a corporation and more of a front for the pre-war military. How appropriate that its secrets have fallen into our hands. And think of what we could do if we understood plasma-based propulsion. "
  bos_nf_robotics_research: "Robotics Research"
  bos_nf_robotics_research_desc: "We firmly believe that thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind. But there's nothing wrong with a fancy toaster."
  bos_nf_cerulean_robotics: "Cerulean Robotics"
  bos_nf_cerulean_robotics_desc: "Cerulean was one of the many subsidiaries of RobCo, based out of what is now Freeside. Despite what the paladins say, they did more than manufacture Fisto robots. We think."
  bos_nf_robco: "RobCo"
  bos_nf_robco_desc: "What can we say about RobCo? Shall we say they were a multibillion dollar robotics and software corporation? Shall we mention they built the first Stealth Boys? Or shall we note that House's maniacal dreams threatened the Wasteland? Perhaps all that should be said is we are the only ones who can be trusted to guard their secrets."
  bos_nf_acme: "Acme"
  bos_nf_acme_desc: "Apparently there was not a single Acme corporation! Instead, many different companies took the name Acme so they could be first in... a telephone book? Really? Truly, the pre-war world was mad."
  bos_nf_theoretical_research: "Theoretical Research"
  bos_nf_theoretical_research_desc: "The ancestors were so close to becoming gods, before the Great War. Holographic replicators; terraforming technology; cheap, unlimited energy. What lesson should we take from their fall? That uncontrolled progress is dangerous."
  bos_nf_future_tec: "Future-Tec"
  bos_nf_future_tec_desc: "Future-Tec made the G.E.C.K. which almost saved the Wasteland. If we could find a way to manufacture them, we could make the world into a veritable garden once again. Or, perhaps, a better world..."
  bos_nf_greenway_hydroponics: "Greenway Hydroponics"
  bos_nf_greenway_hydroponics_desc: "Greenway was one of the few pre-war companies devoted to peaceful technological development and caring for the Earth. No wonder it fell in the Great War along with so many others. But still, perhaps their old ruins have a thing or two to teach us."
  bos_nf_virtual_strategic_solutions: "Virtual Strategic Solutions"
  bos_nf_virtual_strategic_solutions_desc: "Did you know that before the bombs fell, Americans whiled away thousands of hours of their lives on electronic simulations? What degenerate people. We should lock away this lotus eating machine forever. Just after one more turn."
  bos_nf_wmd_research: "WMD Research"
  bos_nf_wmd_research_desc: "We cannot trust the Wasteland with the weapons that destroyed the world once. We shall protect them for their own mistakes by assuming a monopoly over these dangers."
  bos_nf_mininuke_preperation: "Mini-nuke Preparation"
  bos_nf_mininuke_preperation_desc: "The only group that should use mini-nukes is the Brotherhood. We will use them sparingly, with compassion, and with prejudice."
  bos_nf_uranium_stockpiling: "Uranium Stockpiling"
  bos_nf_uranium_stockpiling_desc: "They say greed for uranium once caused a terrible uranium fever, which they got all around. The Brotherhood will be well served to assume control of all uranium to prevent any more sickness."
  bos_nf_shells_and_cells: "Shells and Cells"
  bos_nf_shells_and_cells_desc: "To deploy the weapons of the Great War, we'll need large stockpiles of their ammunition. That means finding or fabricating mini-nuke shells and microfusion cells. It's not as glamorous as stockpiling uranium and plasma cores, but it's critical work nonetheless!"
  bos_nf_mininuke_mass_production: "Mini-nuke Mass Production"
  bos_nf_mininuke_mass_production_desc: "With proper research and planning, we can produce mini-nukes of our own. No longer are we reliant on diminishing pre-war stockpiles. We have harnessed the atom for ourselves!"
  bos_nf_plasma_preperation: "Plasma Preparation"
  bos_nf_plasma_preperation_desc: "Plasma weaponry is so advanced that until now, nobody beyond the Enclave understood how to make it. With proper planning we can change all that."
  bos_nf_plasma_core_stockpiling: "Plasma Core Stockpiling"
  bos_nf_plasma_core_stockpiling_desc: "Let us acquire as many plasma cores as we can, to prepare to upgrade all our knights and paladins to use them."
  bos_nf_microfusion_cell_stockpiling: "Microfusion Cell Stockpiling"
  bos_nf_microfusion_cell_stockpiling_desc: "Sad as it is to admit, there are Brotherhood members who rely upon gunpowder firearms. We need to ensure that we are as feared as we once were. We need unending amounts of energy ammunition."
  bos_nf_plasma_mass_production: "Plasma Mass Production"
  bos_nf_plasma_mass_production_desc: "No longer do we stockpile the weapons of old. Now we make them. The Brotherhood can weaponize the inside of a star and shoot it at all who oppose us!"
  bos_nf_destruction_device_repurposement: "Destruction Device Repurposing"
  bos_nf_destruction_device_repurposement_desc: "It is cowardly to leave a self-destruct device in our bunker. The Brotherhood will never fall! Let us instead use this device for offence, to remind our enemies why Steel never shatters."
  bos_nf_expeditionary_technology: "Expeditionary Technology"
  bos_nf_expeditionary_technology_desc: "Some of our expeditions, proud of their efforts, have shared secrets with Lost Hills. We can utilize some of these designs!"
  bos_nf_p1s_weather_organ: "The Organ of P-1"
  bos_nf_p1s_weather_organ_desc: "The heart of P-1. An instrument of change. Within the Space Needle, pre-war scientists were said to have orchestrated advanced technological manipulations using such technology."
  bos_nf_mxc_warden_protocol: "WARDEN Protocol"
  bos_nf_mxc_warden_protocol_desc: "A piece of software, WARDEN, was designed to automate prison centers. In the post-war era, it is a particularly useful piece of control when combined with hardware that can accept requests from it, allowing one to easily administer large areas of conquest that would otherwise be difficult for man alone."
  bos_nf_moj_holorifles: "Elijah's Holorifles"
  bos_nf_moj_holorifles_desc: "Elijah, the mad genius he is, is said to have invented an ingenious piece of post-war technology during his venture to the Sierra Madre. The Holorifle is its name — utilizing rare technologies in the Sierra Madre to create a powerful armor piercing weapon!"
  bos_nf_shi_greenway_evergrowth: "Greenway Evergrowth"
  bos_nf_shi_greenway_evergrowth_desc: "The Shi had long been attempting to decipher the mysteries of the Evergrowth, a heavily gene-altered species of Chinese arrowroot. 'Gegen Wang'. This species, when unaltered, is commonly seen as invasive.. But the altered plant is particularly effective at eating away at atmospheric radiation! Spreading this species in settlements can effectively prevent the common mutations that occur in more radiated parts of the wasteland."
  bos_nf_android_exoskin: "Android Exoskin"
  bos_nf_android_exoskin_desc: "We aren't too sure about this one. The Guardian Brotherhood simply sent over a strange shipment of rare earth metals made in the shape of skin.\nThe metal, some sort of alloy between steel and ceramic, is particularly durable."
  bos_nf_mch_steam_cores: "Northwest Commonwealth Steam Cores"
  bos_nf_mch_steam_cores_desc: "Steam Cores, a powerful invention of the pre-war United States, was said to at one point be a rival to Microfusion technology. If we can learn how to access this technology our access to energy resources will drastically increase!"
  bos_nf_ach_sentinel_suits: "Sentinel Suits"
  bos_nf_ach_sentinel_suits_desc: "Deep within Fort Hood, the Alamo Chapter found a stockpile of a particular technology. ‘Sentinel Suits' — essentially a combination of humanoid robots and power armour, using specialized robotic engines to drive the motors within the power armour. This, if utilized, could allow us to send out automated expeditions to assist distant chapters!"
  bos_nf_bmw_ach_acme_behemoth_schematics: "Acme Behemoth Schematics"
  bos_nf_bmw_ach_acme_behemoth_schematics_desc: "The "Behemoth" robot was a curious thing. A massive, costly rival to that of RobCo's Liberty Prime project. Expensive to make, vulnerable to espionage, loud and risky -.. But little else in the wasteland had the intimidation factor of a behemoth walker crawling towards your encampment."
  bos_nf_bgf_dreamwater: "Dreamwater"
  bos_nf_bgf_dreamwater_desc: "The Gulf Brotherhood sent us a shipment of what they called Dreamwater, a particular post-war remedy made in Florida. This elixir is said to be vastly more effective then Radaway when it comes to purging radiation from the system — regular consumption effectively acting as an inoculation against common mutation!"
  bos_nf_bap_ultracite_stockpiles: "Ultracite"
  bos_nf_bap_ultracite_stockpiles_desc: "Ultracite, mined primarily in Appalachia, is a particularly lucrative material. When used in composite wires the alloy serves as a great energy conduit and when put into armor it functions as incredibly durable metal! Even bullets made in it were said to be particularly effective against some forms of mutation, such as the Scorch."
  bos_nf_bls_synthetic_life: "Synthetic Life"
  bos_nf_bls_synthetic_life_desc: "From the east coast, a single man was sent to our doorstep. What is so strange about this one that they would send him all the way over?"
  bos_nf_new_expeditions: "New Expeditions"
  bos_nf_new_expeditions_desc: "The Brotherhood is always pushing itself to launch expeditions. We need to reach out, find what technology we can as far away as we can!"

  bos_nf_the_glow_desc: "The West Tek Research Facility, colloquially known as The Glow or Great Glow after the Great War, was founded in 2055 as the primary biological research installation for West Tek, later expanded to accommodate advanced weapons labs. There was a time when we thought that venturing into such a place was impossible, but with modern tech? Maybe it can be accomplished.."
  bos_nf_vault_17: "Vault 17"
  bos_nf_vault_17_desc: "Vault 17, one of the many vaults made by Vault-Tec, was raided in 2155 by Unity, causing the inhabitants to be captured and subsequently turned into super mutants. Perhaps there is some information there that can be found?"
  bos_nf_ghost_farm: "The Ghost Farm"
  bos_nf_ghost_farm_desc: "The Ghost Farm is a small farm at the outskirts of Modoc, created by a group of mutants above their underground settlement."
  bos_nf_ruins_of_broken_hills: "Ruins of Broken Hills"
  bos_nf_ruins_of_broken_hills_desc: "Broken Hills, in years past, was a thriving town — but began but faltered when its uranium mine ran dry. The town, having lost its sole reason for existing, slowly dispersed. The residents carried their riches with them, leaving the place a wind-swept, desolate ghost town. A few hold-outs remained, attempting to eke out a pathetic existence, but eventually, they too, disappeared. Maybe the old miners left some valuable equipment there?"
  bos_nf_irvine: "Irvine"
  bos_nf_irvine_desc: "Once, in ages past, Irvine was a utopia.\nNow there is nothing here but memories. Maybe we can pick it apart, find out what made this city so great in its heyday?"
  bos_nf_cease_and_desist_isotope_chapter: "Raiding the \"Isotope Chapter\""
  bos_nf_cease_and_desist_isotope_chapter_desc: "The \"Isotope Chapter\" is comprised of former members of the Brotherhood of Steel who were exiled by Elder Francis after a failed expedition to the Glow. They ignore Brotherhood protocol by still clinging to the heraldry of the Brotherhood despite in no way being a Brotherhood chapter. Lets send some Paladins to acquire some of the material which is belonged to us that they continue to hold illegally."
  bos_nf_golgotha: "Golgotha"
  bos_nf_golgotha_desc: "In New Reno, it's a tradition that the dead are buried in the graveyard known as Golgotha. What's the difference between looting the bodies of the pre-war dead, and looting the bodies of the post-war dead anyway? If we can find technology buried with the bodies we could make out with a rather hefty haul."
  bos_nf_toxic_caves: "Toxic Caves"
  bos_nf_toxic_caves_desc: "The Toxic Caves, as local citizens call it, is a pre-War military storage facility northwest of Klamath. Perhaps there is some valuable knowledge there that we can find to help our cause?"
  bos_nf_vault_11: "Vault 11"
  bos_nf_vault_11_desc: "A small, isolated little vault in the Mojave, Vault 11 seems sufficient to our efforts. From what we hear the vault is unoccupied, which should make for an easy sweep and retrieve."
  bos_nf_support_the_nevada_free_states: "Support the Nevada Free States"
  bos_nf_support_the_nevada_free_states_desc: "Taggerdy's interaction with the Free States has historically proved unwise for that group. It was the coming together of the good people of Appalachia that ensured that the Scorchbeast threat was ultimately dealt with. Therefore, it is best that we learn from our own institutional history and support this fledgling new branch of the Free States, instead of treating them as any other group of citizens."
  bos_nf_hawaii: "The Port of Honolulu"
  bos_nf_hawaii_desc: "Few citizens make the decision to take a trip out to the far reaches of the world, presenting us a unique opportunity — due to our recent acquisition of a suitable port — to do so! Let's see what the world has in store for us on the other side of the world."
  bos_nf_anchorage: "Anchorage; America's Hope"
  bos_nf_anchorage_desc: "In ancient times, a battlefield known as Anchorage was the defining field of battle between two powerful empires. Perhaps we can find relics there the likes of which were never meant to be found?"
  bos_nf_japan: "Land of the Rising Sun"
  bos_nf_japan_desc: "On the coast of America's rival, a set of islands were known to exist in ancient times — at least, according to common replica globes we have found. If we were to visit this land we might find technology undiscovered for hundreds of years!"
  bos_nf_china: "Sailing the Yangtze"
  bos_nf_china_desc: "It's here, on the Yangtze river at the edge of the known world, that the first major battles were conducted utilizing power armor. The same brave soldiers that would go on to become the Brotherhood of Steel earning their first medals of honour against a foreign enemy in a foreign land. It's a pipe dream that we could ever actually find a way to get here.. But if we could?"
  bos_nf_learning_from_the_ncr_bos_war: "Learning from the NCR-BoS war"
  bos_nf_learning_from_the_ncr_bos_war_desc: "Many brave soldiers died in the NCR-Brotherhood war, we need to honour their sacrifice and learn what we can from this conflict, so that in the future we can come out victorious."
  bos_nf_the_eastern_cities: "The Eastern Cities"
  bos_nf_the_eastern_cities_desc: "Many cities to the east of Lost Hills have a historical positive relation with the Brotherhood due to the dutiful work of field scribes in years past. Let's reach out to them, see if local citizens will be willing to aid the Brotherhood in its time of need."
  bos_nf_necropolis_recruitment: "Ally the Necropolis Resistance"
  bos_nf_necropolis_recruitment_desc: "The Necropolis Resistance is a small group of humans living out of the ruins of Old Necropolis. They have always taken to our support with open arms — maybe they would be willing to allow us to establish a hidden forward outpost in their territory?"
  bos_nf_greenville_recruitment: "Glennville Recruitment"
  bos_nf_greenville_recruitment_desc: "Greenville, in ages past, offered aid to the Brotherhood during our war with the Master's Army. Maybe now that we are in a position of need they can come to us for help?"
  bos_nf_santa_maria_recruitment: "Santa Maria Recruitment"
  bos_nf_santa_maria_recruitment_desc: "Santa Maria, for a brief period, served as the primary coastline for the Brotherhood during our conflict with the NCR — before the city was formally taken, that is. Some citizens there still look fondly back to our occupation of the city, seeing the NCR's more strict legal codes towards wasteland citizens as intrusive."
  bos_nf_santa_barbara_recruitment: "Santa Barbara Recruitment"
  bos_nf_santa_barbara_recruitment_desc: "Santa Barbara, back during the establishment of the NCR was one of the primary trade towns we used to bring supplies from Lost Hills to Maxson."
  bos_nf_maxson_recruitment: "Maxson Recruitment"

Do we try to integrate more of our bordering territory, with the end goal of trying to reach other chapters fully — or do we try to bunker up and hold California in the hopes that other chapters will eventually reach us in time?"
  bos_skip_brotherhood_states_tt: "§CStates currently owned by a Chapter will not generate claims, to avoid insurmountable diplomatic penalties.§!"
  
  bos_nf_utilizing_californias_industry: "Utilizing California's Industry"
  bos_nf_utilizing_californias_industry_desc: "California has a massive, powerful industrial base we can utilize if we make the correct decisions and avoid disturbing too many of the complex pieces holding NCR's mechanisms together."
  bos_nf_utilizing_californias_industry_tt: "Unlocking §CSophisticated§! Industrial Technology also unlocks three §YUnique Technologies§! in the §YIndustrial§! research category."
  bos_nf_the_coast_of_california: "The Coast of California"
  bos_nf_the_coast_of_california_desc: "The Brotherhood has never deployed to the sea, but that must change. Not only might there be secrets beneath the waves; there are threats across them."
  bos_nf_seatrials: "Sea Trials"
  bos_nf_seatrials_desc: "We live in a water world, and it is time we act like that. Trying pre-war technologies on the sea will give us the security we crave."
  bos_nf_screening: "Screening"
  bos_nf_screening_desc: "A mighty warship could be vulnerable to torpedo boats, or even commandos on rafts. We must deploy lighter ships to protect the Brotherhood's fleet!"
  bos_nf_navallexicon: "Naval Lexicon"
  bos_nf_navallexicon_desc: "We must adopt the Brotherhood's lore for the waves. Perhaps we should consider each ship a squad unto itself, and its captain a paladin."
  bos_nf_aircatapults: "Air Catapults"
  bos_nf_aircatapults_desc: "Before the Great War, America sent planes off of carriers. Perhaps we can do so again? Air catapults let us shrink the amount of runway planes need to take off."
  bos_nf_seabehemoths: "Sea Behemoths"
  bos_nf_seabehemoths_desc: "The Brotherhood can deploy the largest warships on the sea now!"
  bos_nf_steelcage: "Steel Cage"
  bos_nf_steelcage_desc: "The Steel Cage, lovingly called the nest by some, has become the pinnacle flagship for our fleets. A pre-war cargo vessel outfitted with artillery heavy laser cannons and a new nuclear reactor. Its armour is nigh invulnerable, and many feel that it is this fleet that confirms our dominance at sea."
  
  bos_nf_the_airways_of_california: "The Airways of California"
  bos_nf_the_airways_of_california_desc: "We tried to learn the secrets of Vertibirds in the 2240's, and although it didn't work, it piqued our interest. It is time for the Chapter that sent armadas of airships east to show why the Bear Force is a farce."
  bos_lyons_model: "Lancers"
  bos_lyons_model_desc: "Lyon's expedition added the Lancer designation, a path from Initiate with as much respect as both the Scribe and Knight. We've adopted their model, to resounding success."
  
  bos_nf_fighters: "Fighters"
  bos_nf_fighters_desc: "Airships, it turns out, are vulnerable to machine gun fire and missiles. By deploying fighters we'll ensure control over the air!"
  bos_nf_support: "Ground Support"
  bos_nf_support_desc: "An air force's true value is protecting our paladins on the ground. We must make sure we can use our newfound air superiority."
  bos_nf_airlexicon: "Air Lexicon"
  bos_nf_airlexicon_desc: "If you think about it, planes are the true knights;moving unconstrained by terrain at rapid speeds, like the heroes of yore. How appropriate that their mechanics are henceforth called squires. "
  bos_nf_behemoths: "Air Behemoths"
  bos_nf_behemoths_desc: "The Superiority fighters of the Old World are overwhelmingly powerful, and incredibly difficult to maintain. With intense fuel and ammunition requirements, many in the Brotherhood argue that their combat effectiveness is far outweighed by the cost of producing them."
  bos_nf_bombers: "Fortress Bombers"
  bos_nf_bombers_desc: "The Fortress Bombers of the Old World are a nightmare to behold, a bustling fortress of machine gun nests and auto turrets to protect a payload capable of levelling all but the most fortified position. They are costly, but few can deny their viability in this new age. The ability to destroy foes without any risk of retaliation is appealing to all."
  bos_nf_scourge: "Scourge"
  bos_nf_scourge_desc: "In the past, the Brotherhood of Steel has made ample use of blimps as transport craft, but only recently, with the fall of the NCR, has returning to use such vehicles en-mass been available to us. Such an undertaking would require an overwhelming understanding of their situational uses, and an in-depth knowledge of all technologies leading up to this revelation."
  bos_nf_securing_nearly_lost_bunkers: "Securing Nearly Lost Bunkers"

  bos_nf_reclaiming_destroyed_bunkers: "Reclaiming Destroyed Bunkers"
  bos_nf_reclaiming_destroyed_bunkers_desc: "While Alpaugh and Blackwell were only mostly claimed, it turns out that most of the bunkers further to the north have been destroyed outright, not a single survivor left! Still, we can reclaim some of these lost bunkers, if we can clear out the wildlife that has taken up hold in them!"
  bos_nf_bunker_atascadero: "Bunker Atascadero"

  bos_nf_bunker_monterey_desc: "A group of Cazadores have taken over the remains of Bunker Monterrey!"
  bos_nf_elders_schemes: "Elders Schemes"
  bos_nf_elders_schemes_desc: "The Brotherhood, typically, does not have a leader like the NCR or a monarchy. Rather, there is a temporary High Elder that is chosen from among the different elders. This is a position that assists primarily with mediating disagreements among the council, but the fact that such a position is needed is proof alone of the instability at the top of the Brotherhood."
  bos_nf_maxsonians: "Maxsonians"
  bos_nf_maxsonians_desc: "The Maxsonians, typically, are the conservatives of the Brotherhood of Steel — those that feel that upholding the Codex, as written, is typically preferential to more interpretive views of the text. These are the elders, notably, who worked to have Elder Elijah sent off to the Mojave in recent years."
  bos_nf_jonathan_maxson_back_to_health: "Jonathan Maxson Back to Health"
  bos_nf_jonathan_maxson_back_to_health_desc: "Remarkably, Jonathan Maxson has returned to full health! It seems it won't take one well-placed bullet to end this titan! With Jonathan Maxson in charge of the Maxsonians the Brotherhood's in a much better position to lead the Maxsonian bloc of elders to a better future."
  bos_nf_coronating_a_new_maxsonian_elder: "Coronation of a New Maxsonian Elder"
  bos_nf_coronating_a_new_maxsonian_elder_desc: "Jonathan Maxson, fabled and heralded he is, cannot lead the Maxsonians forever. His poor health following the injuries he took in the NCR war is key to that. Elder Angharad, one of the war heroes that helped bring down the NCR's gold reserve, is willing to do what it takes to fill Elder Maxson's shoes."
  bos_nf_war_hero_of_the_ncr_war: "War Hero of the NCR War"
  bos_nf_war_hero_of_the_ncr_war_desc: "Elder Angharad is a notable figure among the Brotherhood, and an important figure to help guide the Maxsonian bloc forward following the end of Jonathan Maxson's term."
  bos_nf_honoring_the_maxson_elders: "Honouring the Maxson Elders"
  bos_nf_honoring_the_maxson_elders_desc: "The Maxson line of elders has been the most respected out of any in Lost Hills, considering their institutional role in helping found the organization in the first place."
  bos_nf_the_line_of_succession: "The Line of Succession"
  bos_nf_the_line_of_succession_desc: "The fate of Jonathan Maxson's child, Arthur Maxson, is a closely held secret — considering the potential that Arthur has to upend Lost Hills politics. Normally such a matter would be decided by the family — but we should really weigh in and decide what's best for Arthur, as well."
  bos_nf_rhombians: "Rhombians"
  bos_nf_rhombians_desc: "The Rhombian bloc of the Brotherhood of Steel has historically consisted of moderate reformers, hoping to make sensible reforms to the Codex and the Brotherhood's infrastructure as a whole that make sense in the era of their times. Named after the heralded head paladin of yore, the Rhombians typically align with those who are more supportive of the positive efforts the distant Lyon's Expedition has been making towards assisting civilian sectors."
  bos_nf_honor_the_ncr_war_veterans: "Honour the NCR War Veterans"
  bos_nf_honor_the_ncr_war_veterans_desc: "Our heroes overcame the odds and crushed the Bear's empire. Every Chapter from here to the Capital shall raise a glass in their honour!"
  bos_nf_call_out_poor_military_strategy: "Call Out Poor Military Strategy"
  bos_nf_call_out_poor_military_strategy_desc: "The NCR War shows the limitations of our tactics. What sufficed to crush a band of raiders will not do against nation-states with standing armies. We need to adapt!"
  bos_nf_long_history_of_reform: "Long History of Reform"
  bos_nf_long_history_of_reform_desc: "The Rhombians have a long history of active reform within the Brotherhood of Steel. We need to respect the efforts they made to help adapt the Brotherhood of Steel to changing times."
  bos_nf_reaching_out_to_family: "Reaching Out to Family"
  bos_nf_reaching_out_to_family_desc: "The daughter of Elder Mari, Katherine, is currently living out east with the Brotherhood near Dallas. We should send them some support, if we can!"
  bos_nf_taggerdys_legacy: "Taggerdy's Legacy"
  bos_nf_taggerdys_legacy_desc: "Taggerdy is a important figure to the Rhombians, as she made a important call that few others could make — when faced with the survival of her chapter, or the saviour of the wasteland she made the call to do what had to be done. The battle of Fort Defiance is legendary, and should be respected!"
  bos_nf_new_reforms: "New Reforms"
  bos_nf_new_reforms_desc: "There are plenty of new reforms the Brotherhood can put into place, if we so try! Some of these may prove difficult to get past, however.."
  bos_nf_our_right: "Our Right"
  bos_nf_our_right_desc: "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."
  bos_nf_salvaged_metal: "Salvaged Metal"
  bos_nf_salvaged_metal_desc: "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the Earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."
  bos_nf_increase_power_production: "Increase Power Production"
  bos_nf_increase_power_production_desc: "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They create large amounts of power for relatively low maintenance cost, but they often require specific fuel cells and are difficult to redesign to run off of corn fuel. Investing in power generation will always benefit our equipment output."
  bos_nf_salvaged_electronics: "Salvaged Electronics"
  bos_nf_salvaged_electronics_desc: "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."
  bos_nf_advanced_tech: "Advanced Tech"
  bos_nf_advanced_tech_desc: "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare pre-war technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."
  bos_nf_fueling_our_rise: "Fuelling Our Rise"
  bos_nf_fueling_our_rise_desc: "Fuel comes in all forms, but often our scavenging parties search for the nuclear variety. Unspent fuel cells are incredibly valuable to everyone in the wasteland, but especially to us. They power our power armour, our gatling lasers, and our generators. Securing them is a high priority for all scouts."
  bos_nf_scavenging_program: "Begin Scavenging Programs"
  bos_nf_scavenging_program_desc: "Our salvaging efforts have really paid off as of late. Perhaps there is something to be gained if we were to formalize our scavenging efforts into a proper Paladin-led program!"
  bos_nf_arm_foundries: "Arm Foundries"
  bos_nf_arm_foundries_desc: "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are under-supplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel: "The Circle of Steel"
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel_desc: "The Circle of Steel represent some of our more fanatic members. In general, they hold rigidly to the idea of preserving technology, and have conducted numerous operations to uphold that ideal across the Wasteland. If an Elder or Chapter Leader subverts that mission, it is the Circle of Steel who will visit them, blade in hand."
  bos_circle_of_steel: "Circle of Steel"
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel_brotherhood_spies: "Codex Loyalists"
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel_brotherhood_spies_desc: "Many members of the Circle carry out regular intelligence and auditing duties in their Chapters, as well as resolve internal chapter issues of corruption, stealing, and similar crimes. It wouldn't take much for the Circle to pass these reports on to us."
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel_ncr_spies: "Our Old Enemy"
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel_ncr_spies_desc: "For decades, the Circle has operated in the NCR. They have hidden outposts and high-ranking assets ready and waiting to be utilized. We can order them to be reactivated, though some in the NCR will certainly notice something amiss."
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel_surveillance_bunkers: "Surveil The Wastes"
  bos_nf_circle_of_steel_surveillance_bunkers_desc: "We've known of various facilities across the wastes that are so small only a handful of individuals could be supported by them. By stocking and repairing these tiny bunkers and fallout shelters, we could support more active operations."
  bos_circle_of_steel_surveillance_bunkers: "Surveillance Bunkers"
  bos_circle_of_steel_surveillance_bunkers_desc: "Various remote or well-hidden locations across the wastes have been put to use. Tiny shelters under gas stations, government listening posts, and bunkers constructed by the rich unwilling to share a Vault can all support a small team of operatives. Now they do."
  bos_nf_the_veterans_pension: "The Veterans Pension"
  bos_nf_the_veterans_pension_desc: "Embarrassingly, the Brotherhood has been forced to rely on currency for many of its knights to acquire ammunition. During the NCR war quartermasters bought microfusion cells from the Van Graffs, who sold them, in turn, to knights. Now we have a swathe of knights who are in debt to their quartermasters, who in turn owe the Van Graffs. We need to address this directly."
  bos_nf_currency_reform: "Currency Reform"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_desc: "The Brotherhood's expansion forces it to deal with something scarier than the Master, the Enclave, and the Legion combined — market forces. If we will truly secure the Wasteland, we'll need to interact with its people and, ugh, find a means of trade."
  bos_nf_finding_caps: "Finding Caps"
  bos_nf_finding_caps_desc: "Although traditionally the Brotherhood has looked down on trade, in our earliest days we did trade with the merchants of the Hub. Perhaps we could sell limited amounts of high technology for caps."
  bos_nf_bounty_hunting: "Bounty Hunting"
  bos_nf_bounty_hunting_desc: "The Brotherhood in Appalachia once earned money and rewards doing favours for local settlers. There's no reason the Western Brotherhood can't do likewise! It's a bit embarrassing, but we should do whatever we can to ensure the Chain remains unbroken."
  bos_nf_debts_of_the_quartermasters: "Debts of the Quartermasters"
  bos_nf_debts_of_the_quartermasters_desc: "Thanks to our economic reforms, we can now pay off the debts of the Quartermasters in a lump payment to the Van Graffs. Hopefully this will be the end of that affair."
  bos_nf_adjusting_to_bunker_life: "Adjusting to Bunker Life"
  bos_nf_adjusting_to_bunker_life_desc: "Among the Brotherhood, for those living near Lost Hills, it's going to be a bit of a change for us to go from multiple bunkers to just one. We will need to acclimate to Bunker life if we are to make this a comfortable existence!"
  bos_nf_enforce_recycling_programs: "Enforce Recycling Programs"
  bos_nf_enforce_recycling_programs_desc: "In a bunker, almost like living in space, bringing in any new material is exceedingly expensive. If a major engine breaks it can take months to find a suitable replacement, gather a team to obtain it, then have a team of scribes work to install it. By enforcing a program of regular recycling we can reduce the need to bring in more tech from out of the Bunker, leading to a more self-sufficient Lost Hills."
  bos_nf_repairing_ventilation_systems: "Repair Ventilation Systems"
  bos_nf_repairing_ventilation_systems_desc: "Lost Hills ventilation systems are going to be very important, considering the vast number of people now living underground. We want everyone to be breathing in clean air, after all!"
  bos_nf_finding_new_living_space: "Finding New Living Space"
  bos_nf_finding_new_living_space_desc: "It is going to take some work to make some of our sub-sections more liveable to account for our growing population. Let's solve this before it gets cramped!"
  bos_nf_advanced_scavenging: "Advanced Scavenging"
  bos_nf_advanced_scavenging_desc: "We are now ready to begin an advanced scavenging program, searching the wastelands for valuable technology!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_weaponry: "Scavenging Weaponry"
  bos_nf_scavenging_weaponry_desc: "Pre-war America had firearms everywhere, from schools to hospitals to bowling alleys. We must scour all these places and more for firearms!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_plasma: "Looking for Lasers in All the Wrong Places"
  bos_nf_scavenging_plasma_desc: "I wish we could get some plasma guns. Oh well."
  bos_nf_scavenging_laser_rifles: "Scavenging Laser Rifles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_laser_rifles_desc: "Old army bases still contain stockpiles of laser weaponry. We must seize them before anyone else does!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_heavy_energy_weapons: "Scavenging Heavy Energy Weapons"
  bos_nf_scavenging_heavy_energy_weapons_desc: "It's not quite clear who the American army needed laser gatling weapons to use again. Were the Chinese truly so dangerous? Or did they have super-mutants of their own to fight."
  bos_nf_scavenging_support_equipment: "Scavenging Support Equipment"
  bos_nf_scavenging_support_equipment_desc: "Radios, helmets, wrenches, nuka cola energy drinks — these are not as flashy as plasma cells, but are no less necessary for a squad."
  bos_nf_scavenging_medical_equipment: "Scavenging Medical Equipment"
  bos_nf_scavenging_medical_equipment_desc: "There is little pre-war medical supplies remaining, but we should still acquire what remains. We need stimpaks and antibiotics far more than an average Wastelander. At least, we serve them more."
  bos_nf_scavenging_piercing_weaponry: "Scavenging Piercing Weaponry"
  bos_nf_scavenging_piercing_weaponry_desc: "The NCR calls rocket launchers 'can openers' and uses them to take down loyal knights. Obviously we can't let these weapons fall into the wrong hands."
  bos_nf_scavenging_big_weaponry: "Scavenging Big Weaponry"
  bos_nf_scavenging_big_weaponry_desc: "This is your rifle, this is your gun. And this is your mortar. The mortar is probably the best of the three, to be honest."
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor: "Scavenging Power Armour"
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor_desc: "Power Armour turned the tide in the Great War, helping American forces drive to the gates of Beijing. Now these suits of armour are the very emblem of the Brotherhood. We've got to collect them all!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_t45: "Scavenging T-45d Power Armour"
  bos_nf_scavenging_t45_desc: "West-Tek's T-45d power armour was the first unit to be deployed to the front lines. Although it is somewhat obsolete, it is far better than nothing for our knights. Perhaps we can find a few suits still around."
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor_repair: "Power Armour Repair"
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor_repair_desc: "Two centuries of repairing power armour have made us experts at doing so. We can make every suit go a bit farther if we don't mind replacing some components with things we found in prewar toys."
  bos_nf_scavenging_t51b: "Scavenging T-51b Power Armour"
  bos_nf_scavenging_t51b_desc: "They say there is so much T-51b out east that in the Commonwealth, people treat their suits like the sports cars of old? That has to be a legend, but it might be worth checking for ourselves. And if they've painted a suit hot pink? Then they don't deserve to live."
  bos_nf_scavenging_vehicles: "Scavenging Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_vehicles_desc: "We really need to find more vehicles if we want to travel the Wasteland. Even in power armour, it's a long road to the Capital Wasteland! Perhaps we can check old car lots, parking garages, or bus depots?"
  bos_nf_scavenging_mobile_vehicles: "Scavenging Mobile Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_mobile_vehicles_desc: "Although most pre-war vehicles have fallen into disarray by now, there are still some army vehicles that were prepared for the end. We can take inspiration from our colleagues in the Midwest and deploy more troops in them."
  bos_nf_scavenging_durable_vehicles: "Scavenging Durable Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_durable_vehicles_desc: "We really don't need Cherry Bomb cars. We need vehicles that can go off-road, through water, or over mountains."
  bos_nf_scavenging_advanced_vehicles: "Scavenging Advanced Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_advanced_vehicles_desc: "Pre-war American tanks have little use in the Wasteland. They require the industrial base of a nation millions strong and rich beyond our imagination to support. But, it can't hurt to acquire any that are out there. Better we have them than the Eighties."
  bos_nf_greater_reforms: "Greater Reforms"
  bos_nf_greater_reforms_desc: "It's time we make some greater reforms to institutions that have long held true to the Brotherhood of Steel. To believe in an ideal is to be willing to betray it, after all."
  bos_nf_outsider_initiation: "Outsider Initiation"
  bos_nf_outsider_initiation_desc: "We've long been sceptical of outsiders, but the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One are far not the only outsiders we've let in. Let us draw inspiration from the Midwest and welcome outsiders to the Brotherhood"
  bos_nf_initiate_ncr_settlers: "Initiate NCR Citizens"
  bos_nf_initiate_ncr_settlers_desc: "Many within the NCR recognize the rot that infects the Republic. They seek unity. They seek purpose. They will find a home in the Brotherhood, the true saviours of California. Especially the Maxson settlers."
  bos_nf_initiate_ranger_turncoats: "Initiate Ranger Turncoats"
  bos_nf_initiate_ranger_turncoats_desc: "Not all of the Rangers bought the Republic's lies. Some of them know that only the Brotherhood can truly safeguard mankind; and some are simply sickened by the injustice that now reigns."
  bos_nf_initiate_necropolis_ghouls: "Initiate Necropolis Ghouls"
  bos_nf_initiate_necropolis_ghouls_desc: "Although we are no friends to ghouls, it cannot be denied that many of the ones from Necropolis possess a certain technical acumen. Some of them are worthy of joining the Brotherhood!"
  bos_nf_limited_super_mutant_initiation: "Limited Super Mutant Initiation"
  bos_nf_limited_super_mutant_initiation_desc: "As radical as having a super mutant in the Brotherhood might be, we have cooperated before. Wasn't Broken Hills founded by the Brotherhood working with a super mutant? Has not the Midwest shown they can form a part of the chain?"
  bos_nf_commitment_to_duty: "Commitment to Duty"
  bos_nf_commitment_to_duty_desc: "If we start giving soldiers citizenry currency directly they will simply use it as an excuse to mingle with those outside of our organization. It diminishes the righteousness of our cause if we were to give soldiers payment for following the codex, essentially turning Maxson's vision into any ordinary job. By making a commitment that we won't change how this operates within the foreseeable future, we effectively put this off to a later date."
  bos_nf_commitment_to_purity: "Commitment to Purity"
  bos_nf_commitment_to_purity_desc: "If we were to expand our ranks past the Brotherhood's core, then we might risk diminishing what it even means to be a member of the Brotherhood. All members of the Brotherhood must be initiated, as it confers a sacred connection that is carried down all the way from Arthur Maxson. To diminish that by integrating criminals and mutants would jeopardize our very core."
  bos_manpower_problem_tt: "Taking this focus is a requirement for the §YFinding Our Advantage§! foci, located after §YPreparing for the Ceasefires End§!"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_caps: "Caps"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_caps_desc: "Caps have no value on their own, but they are redeemable for water from the Hub. If nothing else, this will commit us to a hydraulic empire, gaining wealth and power from control of irrigation and California's farms."
  bos_nf_currency_reform_gold_bullion: "Gold Bullion"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_gold_bullion_desc: "Why is gold valuable? Who can say, but none can deny it. Gold has value throughout the Wasteland, so what better to use as a currency?"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_ncr_dollar: "NCR Dollar"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_ncr_dollar_desc: "For all the Republic's many, many faults, it has developed an industrialized economy in the West. Adopting the NCR dollar will make our interactions with its citizens easier."
  bos_nf_currency_reform_scrip: "Scrip"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_scrip_desc: "The Midwest is radical, but we must salute their plan to develop their own currency. If we were to adopt Scrip, we could combine the East and West in a mighty economic sphere! All of the Wasteland's livelihood will be tied to the Brotherhood — much like their future."
  bos_nf_open_up_to_traders: "Open Up to Traders"
  bos_nf_open_up_to_traders_desc: "While individual soldiers have been, during their off hours, trading some goods with traders while they were out of uniform it has never been an official policy of the Brotherhood of Steel to endorse this sort of trade. No longer! We can make a decision to actively support foreign trade with the wastelands traders, helping to establish a proper trade network between Lost Hills and the rest of the wasteland!"
  bos_nf_council_reforms: "Council Reforms"
  bos_nf_council_reforms_desc: "It has been a few good years since the High Elder position has held real power, the war with the NCR causing the Paladins and Council to have much more sway over bunker politics. With the ceasefire, an opportunity has opened up to attempt to return the Brotherhood to normalcy."
  bos_nf_head_elder_duty_duration: "High Elder Promotion Duration"
  bos_nf_head_elder_duty_duration_desc: "Historically, during the Brotherhood's golden age the position of High Elder was typically held for life. While it may be some time until we can recreate such an age, we can at least make some decisions to attempt to formalize the High Elder positions' recent usage."
  bos_nf_political_blocs: "Political Blocs"
  bos_nf_political_blocs_desc: "Often, elders decide on issues based on a vague ‘party line', choosing things those they consider allies also choose. By codifying some of the political blocs among different elders we can reduce the amount of control individual elders have to vote outside of their blocs opinion."
  bos_nf_election_on_demand: "Promotion On Demand"
  bos_nf_election_on_demand_desc: "In recent years, a new High Elder has been chosen for promotion once every year or so. The ability to break this format and, with a bit of a push, host an election at-will may prove to be beneficial to manipulating whatever political schemes we wish for."
  bos_nf_paladins_given_some_sway: "Paladins Given Some Sway"
  bos_nf_paladins_given_some_sway_desc: "The paladins of the Brotherhood of Steel are a influential part of our organization, yes — but historically only influential on the battlefield, away from the politics of the elders.

A truly staggering portion of the Brotherhood is oriented around assuaging the distrust of the NCR's citizens. Patrols are slow and vulnerable, laden down with aid supplies for distribution.\n\nSignificantly more personnel thus need to be devoted to the task - but there will likely be long-term benefits to the work being done now, and less deaths in the present overall, so long as the Brotherhood isn't forced to whole states to the mercies of the Wasteland."

The Scribes and Elders in different states have struggled to coordinate in war-torn California, with limited radio communications and a reduced ability for states to send and receive couriers amongst the madness of raiders and resistance. On top of our issues with communication, some newly-recognized Elders took the opportunity to experiment in accordance with their faction's politics, completely ignoring the municipal governments in critical industrial centers. \nNow, with the unrest quieting down, we're putting into place a working federal government, which will bring the Californian economy back to at least a shadow of its former self as we enact a set of unified economic and political reforms.\n\n We should also consider the impact of the rising Barons, who would certainly be most receptive to a Rhombian or Reformer plan that preserves more of the free market, if we want to work with them.

  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.8.d: "As California emerged from the ashes of the war, the Hub became a beacon of hope for many. The trade city was bustling with activity, as merchants from all over the wasteland converged there to trade their wares. However, as the city grew once again in prominence, so did the violence between gangs of competing smugglers who vied for control of the lucrative trade routes. The Caravan Companies operating in the Hub, like the Crimson Caravan and Water Merchants, bought up the street gangs during the war for security, leading to a return of the Great Merchant Wars that plagued the Hub in 2126.\n\n The Hub is a city that was both a vital center of commerce and a den of lawlessness. As such, the Elders bicker based on what they see- some argue that the government should broker a deal with the merchant-gangs, offering them amnesty and legitimacy in exchange for their cooperation in keeping the peace. Others believe that the only way to restore order is to eliminate the gangs entirely, using force as necessary.\n\nThose who favor brokering a deal point out that the merchants were the lifeblood of the Hub's economy, with their criminal activities being a necessary evil in order to maintain stability as the NCR collapsed. If we legitimize the gangs, we could ensure that they operate within the bounds of the law by recognizing them as security companies, likely dropping inner city violence substantially.\n\nThose who favor eliminating the gangs, on the other hand, argue that the government had a duty to uphold the law, even if it means disrupting the city's economy. They point out that the gangs were responsible for countless murders, robberies, and other crimes, and that the government's failure to act would only embolden them further."

However, as resistance has faded and the demands of governance encroached, we must consider the implications of renaming ourselves to the Californian Brotherhood.\n\nThe Rhombian Elders, and some Reformers, argue that the name change would reflect our new reality. California is dotted with new impromptu war memorials: burned-out buildings, downed power lines, new craters collecting radioactive rainwater, and communities wiped out or cleared out and never to return. The citizens of California suffered greatly during the war, and it's vital for the Brotherhood to show that we are now a part of the rebuilding effort - not as foreign despots, but as long-term residents.\n\nSome, though, are wary of the change. It's undeniable that the government bunkers of Lost Hills are our home, and some feel that even if we rename ourselves and send Elders to Shady Sands, the real power would always remain here, in these bunkers.\n\nThey argue we must keep the name Lost Hills as a reminder of our past, and to continue to honor the traditions and values that have guided us for so long. To do anything else would be to erode the legacy of Maxson without having seen through his goals.\n\nFinally, the rest of the reformers argue the road ahead will be long and arduous, but if we're committed to doing everything in our power to help the people of California rebuild, then a new name will show that we consider all Californians now to be our siblings, and that we're ready to welcome them into our ranks."

  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.11.d: "[BOS.getLeader],\n\nThe situation in California has grown dire. Our occupation of the NCR has been met with a ruthless response from the Barons, lead by Anton Flynn, who have tightened their grip on the food supply to devastating effect.\n\nFood prices have climbed quickly, with the result that people across California are struggling to put food on the table and the worst off are already going hungry.\n\nWhen we traveled to the Barons' land to investigate the cause of this, we were met with violence - granaries were burned, and male livestock were slaughtered.\n\nIt's clear that the Barons are willing to go to any lengths to maintain their power, even if it means starving the people of California. We've backed off our presence in Baron lands to avoid an unstoppable famine, but the Barons remain influential in deciding if, when, and how severe this famine might be.\n\nThere is some good news - Southern California is still producing and selling food. But with the Barons controlling such a great share of the farms and livestock in the NCR, we must take swift action to ensure the people of California have sufficient access to the food they need to survive.\n\nWe urge you to consider next steps carefully. If we do not act soon, the consequences could be catastrophic.\n\n—Senior Knights Sean and Daniel Diaz, Agricultural Inspectors"

  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.13.t: "The Legacy Government"
  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.13.d: "[BOS.getLeader], our implementation of a new government has largely succeeded. NCR Congresspeople have been replaced with our own appointed Elders, with each Elder usually representing the interests of  whole regions like Necropolis, Blackwells, or Alpaugh. While the NCR's Congress was not suited to a single representative for places of such varying importance, our process relies on Elder autonomy and not majority vote. Our congress decides what problems to address, but you decide the degree to which the solutions must match. Except a few elders who've lost their positions for misconduct or ineffectiveness, these Elders are largely retaining their wartime appointments, and will continue to do so unless you dismiss them, they step down, or their subordinates force a change in leadership through Codex law.\n\n This does mean, however, that powerful political elements have been cast down to the local level, becoming influential mayors in settlements across California, and keeping in contact with like-minded individuals.\n\nKimball, Allgood, and Hayes represent most of the legacy government. Kimball is weaj despite his previous presidency, and would be a good candidate if we simply want the legacy government to fade from relevancy. Kimball is also close ally of the Barons and could allow for a diplomatic end to this crisis, and shares our pro-war footing in some respects. Working with Allgood or Hayes to implement some of the policies they originally campaigned on could keep the unrest from the famine undoing a lot of our work across the nation should it worsen.\n\nIn the case of Allgood, their focus on good relations with us and eliminating corruption and crime in California would provide an experienced hand in our already ongoing efforts. No elder would find much to complain about in such a move, except for Allgood's close relationship with the Followers.\n\nGrant C. Hayes is known for their dim view of the Brotherhood criticising our safekeeping of technology and the cold shoulder we've given to foreign aid. The Troika or Reformers may be able to bring the industrial expertise of Hayes and Dayglow to the national level, along with their agenda against the Barons, considering their support of Hayes' points.\n\nWe could also just ignore all of them – the unrest from the famine will remain a problem, but we won’t tie our hands when it comes time to deal with the Barons directly.\n\n§BAll advisors take the place of a Cultural Advisor.§!"

At worst, it's active arming of Anton Flynn and his Barons. We must take action against the Gun Runners and Van Graffs, before it's too late."

  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.1601.t: "The Barons: A Meeting Over Dinner"
  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.1601.d: "On the outskirts of Redding, [BOS.getLeader] as well as the three other leaders attend a diplomatic dinner at Anton Flynn's estate. The hall itself is warm and inviting, and many key Barons have come to discuss their grievances. Beyond the opulence of the hall, however, is the truth - Anton's estate swarms with guards from both sides. A paladin paired with some merc is hardly an even fight, but we are outnumbered deep within enemy territory. Our nearest bases also remain on high alert, ready to put boots on the ground here within half an hour of our call. Finally, insisted upon by [BOS.getLeader], the voluntary use of Stealthboys was approved, and more Paladins remain hidden on the grounds, just in case.\n\nBack at the dinner, Anton makes his speech - "[BOS.getLeader], I stand before you today not as an adversary, but as a voice of reason and advocate for our shared vision of prosperity. I understand the skepticism you may hold towards the Barons and our actions, but I implore you to hear us out with an open mind. The incorrigible famine that plagues our great nation was not our intention, but an unforeseen consequence of our efforts to secure our interests. However, this challenge also presents an opportunity for redemption.\n\nOur agricultural might, though immense, has caused hardships amongst the people of California. Our discord has been poisonous to the people, but I -we- assure you, there is still time to rectify this situation.\n\nOur farms can once again flourish and feed the hungry masses, but we cannot do it alone. What is incorrigible for either one of us alone is correctable together. We recognize the expertise and strength of the Brotherhood, and its only with your guidance and assistance that we can bring an end to this crisis. We propose a collaboration, a partnership if you will, where our resources and expertise are fully utilized across California for the greater good. Let us combine our efforts, and begin healing the new scars of our great nation.\n\nBrothers, and Sisters, the fate of California rests in our hands, and together we can make a difference that will be remembered for generations to come."\n\nMore details of exactly what the Barons were asking for came throughout the night... but, ultimately it was quite simple - amnesty for most Barons, including Anton Flynn, the return of Kimball-era rules for business in the agricultural sector, and a chance to repair their image in central and southern California. We could do this without destroying ourselves politically, but what's to prevent the Barons from trying again once we're depleted by some future war?"

They remain corrupt, but not seditious, as we've reverted to the Kimball Era rules in their primary business - agriculture."

  #Hayes version of 16
  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.1602.t: "The Barons: Hayes"
  nf_brotherhood_elh_events.1602.d: "Grant C. Hayes has finally completed their plan to end the Barons. Carefully, they've coordinated a smear campaign against Anton Flynn and the Barons - radio broadcasts and news programs featured all the evidence we could muster of the Baron's leaving californians out to dry. Hayes gave a speech, saying "The truth of the matter, having been hidden from you by the men of Redding, is that there is no shortage of food. There was no disease amongst the cattle, and no fungus in the granaries. I have been to farms seized by the Brotherhood, and I promise all Californians that they speak the truth. \n\nBut it is true that too much food lies in the hands of Anton Flynn and his cronies. These barons would see you, the hard-working farmhands, burn your own meals for the promise of future riches. But I have a better offer - My tax plan will see the Barons destitute, and their property passed on to employees. Their wealth will be used to bring down food prices once again, and give each and every one of you a house, with a white picket fence. Your bosses will order you to work tonight with knife or flame in hand. But all you must do is go home. Walk off your ranches, abandon your barns. The Brotherhood is coming, and by the morning there will be new management." \n\nHaving already chipped away at the support The Hub, The Arms Dealers, and the Legacy Government provided, we've completely isolated Redding. With Hayes' speech as a signal, many dozens of squads walk synchronously onto the grounds of Baron lands. Some encounter resistance - mostly from unarmoured loyalists with laser pistols and hunting rifles - but most find employees willing, if not eager, to help them put an end to this madness."

His last public photo is smug - the grin of a man who still believes his cachet with the legacy government will protect him. His future months of disavowing the Barons, the Stockmen's Association as a whole, and preaching the evils of rampant cronyism will disabuse him of that notion, soon enough."

For whatever reason, it was never filled, with no more than a few thousand ever having lived here. \n\nThe City of Tomorrow is not cramped hallways full of rooms upon rooms. Instead, it's comprised of parks and distinct buildings like office spaces or hydroponic farms, with a webbing of catwalks near the ceiling to service the hundreds of HEPA filters as the only blemish on an otherwise believeable sky. \n\nThe complex was even built on a distinct water source that avoids the need for a Water Chip, and at this point our scribes were giddy at the idea of studying so many incredible feats of engineering. When they thought nothing else could impress them, our Paladins found the largest intact library we'd ever seen — full of digitzed and paper books alike! The scribes knew they were spoiled for choice on what to study, but also knew we'd have to be seen leaving China too soon to study it all."

  srg_the_field_scribes_corps_desc: "To service our transformative ambitions for Maxson, we need fulfill the new manpower requirements of the Field Scribes, and we need the very best. Anyone recruited to this purpose will never again be eligible for duty in our armed forces."
  srg_making_the_most: "Cutting Across the Wastes"
  srg_making_the_most_desc: "Once the first semester of MSU has concluded, we can start filling the thousands of Field Scribe positions in Maxson. They'll work to restore roads and vehicles as well as preparing new settlements for an influx of settlers."
  srg_settling_the_lucia_range: "Settling the Lucia Range"
  srg_settling_the_lucia_range_desc: "The settler group for the Lucia Range arrives, full of skilled workers ready to expand the livable space in the badlands and pave the way for compact industries and infrastructure. Together with the Diablo Range settlers, we'll have good overland connections to San Francisco for the first time."
  srg_settling_the_diablo_range: "Settling the Diablo Range"
  srg_settling_the_diablo_range_desc: "Settling the Diablo Range is no easy feat. The mountainous terrain and hostile critters there demand hardier settlers than most territory in Maxson. It's a great help that expatriates of San Francisco are among the settlers, and the spectacle of seeing a giant bug axe-kicked clean in half is something else!"
  srg_settling_the_badlands: "No More Badlands"
  srg_settling_the_badlands_desc: "The Field Scribes have worked tirelessly to turn the badlands into livable territory, and much of our state budget has gone into the effort.\n\nThe results are worth it."  
  srg_growing_central_valley_outskirts: "The Growth of Central Valley's Outskirts"
  srg_growing_central_valley_outskirts_desc: "Whether we like it or not, the NCR's public campaigning has been very effective, and many have flocked to Central Valley's surrounding states for the benefit of their children, all needing direction to existing settlements or key areas before we have an unmanagable diaspora. The work of the Field Scribes never ends!"
  srg_growing_maxson_city_outskirts: "The Growth of Maxson City's Suburbs"
  srg_growing_maxson_city_outskirts_desc: "Maxson City, unsurprisingly, is very dense. Some NCR migrants have come only at the promise of the Old World revived, and are shocked by the insular culture of Maxson City. They've taken refuge in the suburbs, and most are factory workers who'd love the chance to build fibre-optic cables, computers, and other things rarely produced new."
  srg_growing_the_settlements: "New Opportunities"
  srg_growing_the_settlements_desc: "The provinces bordering Central Valley and Necropolis have seen new families take up residence, moving here to give opportunity to their children. While there's not enough work for them yet, if we're to attract interestd companies we'll need a heavier military presence."  
  srg_growing_our_new_settlements: "Compact Industries"
  srg_growing_our_new_settlements_desc: "Our new settlements in the Lucia and Diablo Ranges will always be constrained in size, but there's industries worth their square footage. If the NCR ever connects up San Francisco, just the trade links would justify our investment."
  srg_growing_our_new_settlements_2: "College Towns"
  srg_growing_our_new_settlements_2_desc: "The families who've settled around Central Valley have naturally been starting new businesses, or joining new expansions by traditional companies in the NCR. The most difficult part for us has been getting them to adopt our industrial technologies!"
  srg_growing_ranger_arms_production: "Steel for the Steel Rangers"
  srg_growing_ranger_arms_production_desc: "After years of work, we've finally set up production chains capable of supporting massive production of military equipment for our armed forces. Now, the most educated and skilled have congregated around our industrial centers as we open arms manufactories outside Central Valley."
  srg_new_military_doctrine: "Reforming Our Doctrine"
  srg_new_military_doctrine_desc: "Brotherhood doctrine is all but gone from the Steel Rangers, thanks to the massive size of our forces now compared to the size of our Knights. If we are to live up to the "Steel" in Steel Rangers, we have much retraining to do."
  srg_special_ops: "Spec Ops Focus"
  srg_special_ops_desc: "We've always used special forces equipment in addition to power armour, but it may be time to adapt to the NCR's doctrine, giving these technologies primacy."
  srg_power_armour: "Powered Armour Focus"
  srg_power_armour_desc: "We are the Steel Rangers, and that means reaching to the heights of pre-war power armour. The NCR will be stronger if Brotherhood doctrine prevails in Maxson."
  srg_knight_subunits: "Integrate Knights"
  srg_knight_subunits_desc: "The Brotherhood Model will persist as part of the Joint Administration. Our Knights will no longer serve as solo units, but instead as additional power-armoured support for the many divisions of the Steel Rangers, in conjunction with the NCR's idea of power-armoured support. We'll recruit the best as Apprentice-Knights."
  srg_paladin_patrols: "Paladin Patrols"
  srg_paladin_patrols_desc: "Our Paladins are too few in number to be a serious combat force for the Steel Rangers. However, they'll bring great comfort to the people of California when seen on patrol, resolving disputes or clearing out wasteland critters without losses."
  srg_paladin_patrols_idea: "Ranger Paladins"
  srg_were_ready: "We're Ready"
  srg_were_ready_desc: "While it will still be decades before Maxson has settled into its new duality of teacher and defender, the Steel Rangers have been reorganized into a worthwhile fighting force. When we deploy, we'll be the steel wall that the Legion, the Warren, or anybody else breaks upon."
  srg_recruitment_drive: "Elite Training"
  srg_recruitment_drive_desc: "Our massive pool of applicants has buried talent better used in our special forces. If we slow down the process, we could seriously expand the size of the Steel Rangers."
  srg_new_special_forces: "Enhanced Screening Procedures"
  srg_every_man_is_precious: "Every Life Is Precious"
  srg_every_man_is_precious_desc: "If there's one thing we've learned from our history, every life is precious. A well-trained, well-equipped individuual is worth five poorly trained ones. Doubly so when we have manufactories to staff."
  srg_superior_enforcers: "Cutting Edge Armour"
  srg_quantity_is_its_own_quality: "Quantity Over Quality"
  srg_quantity_is_its_own_quality_desc: "The NCR doctrine demands a large and expansive army. With their industrial base, there is no reason for us to focus on small elite forces. Let us fill the skies, overflow the seas, and block the roads with our forces."
  srg_a_big_army: "Large Army Doctrine"
  srg_preparing_against_our_foes: "Preparing Against Our Foes"
  srg_preparing_against_our_foes_desc: "We must adopt new plans and stratagems in order to protect against the major threats in the Wasteland. There is no second chance to rebuild society."
  srg_preparing_against_csr: "Analyzing The Mojave Theatre"
  srg_preparing_against_csr_desc: "The Mojave will always be instrumental in defending the NCR. The tribes of the east can't help themselves but attempt to conquer it, and we must make sure the Mojave always returns to the Republic."
  srg_preparing_against_csr_2: "Exploiting their Divisions"
  srg_preparing_against_csr_2_desc: "Now that conflict has broken out, it's obvious our enemy is fractured and tribal. We can gain a great advantage by carrying out logistics strikes against particular tribes - their infighting will do the rest."  
  srg_preparing_against_bos: "Besting our Own"
  srg_preparing_against_bos_desc: "We've tried to convince the other Chapters to join with us, but some will need to be brought into the Rangers by force. We'd best prepare thoroughly for such a conflict."
